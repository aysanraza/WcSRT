## Rationale                   
The research literature is immense in the biomedical domain. In order to take an overview of a certain domain of work, it requires a lot of time to search, decide, and skim the research literature. There is a need for graph based summarizers for research papers in any biomedical domain.

## Introduction          
wcsrt is a word-cloud based summarizer for research topics in the biomedical domain. The software is designed to intake the text based "research topic term" and outputs a single visualization of word cloud representation based on the topics of research papers in that particular domain of knowledge.
